### Q7: Explain briefly the logistic regression model and state an example of when you have used it recently. ###

Answer:

Logistic regression is used to calculate the probability of occurrence of an event in the form of a dependent output variable based on independent input variables. Logistic regression is commonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. If the probability is bigger than 0.5 then it will belong to that class (positive) and if it is below 0.5 it will belong to the other class. This will make it a binary classifier.

It is important to remember that the Logistic regression isn't a classification model, it's an ordinary type of regression algorithm, and it was developed and used before machine learning, but it can be used in classification when we put a threshold to determine specific categories"

There is a lot of classification applications to it:

Classify email as spam or not, To identify whether the patient is healthy or not, and so on.

### Q8: Explain briefly batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. and what are the pros and cons for each of them? ###

Gradient descent is a generic optimization algorithm cable for finding optimal solutions to a wide range of problems. The general idea of gradient descent is to tweak parameters iteratively in order to minimize a cost function.

Batch Gradient Descent:
In Batch Gradient descent the whole training data is used to minimize the loss function by taking a step toward the nearest minimum by calculating the gradient (the direction of descent)

Pros:
Since the whole data set is used to calculate the gradient it will be stable and reach the minimum of the cost function without bouncing (if the learning rate is chosen cooreclty)

Cons:

Since batch gradient descent uses all the training set to compute the gradient at every step, it will be very slow especially if the size of the training data is large.


Stochastic Gradient Descent:

Stochastic Gradient Descent picks up a random instance in the training data set at every step and computes the gradient based only on that single instance.

Pros:
1. It makes the training much faster as it only works on one instance at a time.
2. It become easier to train large datasets

Cons:

Due to the stochastic (random) nature of this algorithm, this algorithm is much less regular than the batch gradient descent. Instead of gently decreasing until it reaches the minimum, the cost function will bounce up and down, decreasing only on average. Over time it will end up very close to the minimum, but once it gets there it will continue to bounce around, not settling down there. So once the algorithm stops the final parameters are good but not optimal. For this reason, it is important to use a training schedule to overcome this randomness.

Mini-batch Gradient:

At each step instead of computing the gradients on the whole data set as in the Batch Gradient Descent or using one random instance as in the Stochastic Gradient Descent, this algorithm computes the gradients on small random sets of instances called mini-batches.

Pros: 
1. The algorithm's progress space is less erratic than with Stochastic Gradient Descent, especially with large mini-batches.
2. You can get a performance boost from hardware optimization of matrix operations, especially when using GPUs.

Cons: 
1. It might be difficult to escape from local minima.

### Q9: Explain what is information gain and entropy in the context of decision trees. ###
Entropy and Information Gain are two key metrics used in determining the relevance of decision-making when constructing a decision tree model and determining the nodes and the best way to split.

The idea of a decision tree is to divide the data set into smaller data sets based on the descriptive features until we reach a small enough set that contains data points that fall under one label.

Entropy is the measure of impurity, disorder, or uncertainty in a bunch of examples. Entropy controls how a Decision Tree decides to split the data.
Information gain calculates the reduction in entropy or surprise from transforming a dataset in some way. It is commonly used in the construction of decision trees from a training dataset, by evaluating the information gain for each variable and selecting the variable that maximizes the information gain, which in turn minimizes the entropy and best splits the dataset into groups for effective classification.

### Q10: Explain the linear regression model and discuss its assumption. ###
Linear regression is a supervised statistical model to predict dependent variable quantity based on independent variables.
Linear regression is a parametric model and the objective of linear regression is that it has to learn coefficients using the training data and predict the target value given only independent values.

Some of the linear regression assumptions and how to validate them:

1. Linear relationship between independent and dependent variables
2. Independent residuals and the constant residuals at every x
We can check for 1 and 2 by plotting the residuals(error terms) against the fitted values (upper left graph). Generally, we should look for a lack of patterns and a consistent variance across the horizontal line.
3. Normally distributed residuals
We can check for this using a couple of methods:
* Q-Q-plot(upper right graph): If data is normally distributed, points should roughly align with the 45-degree line.
* Boxplot: it also helps visualize outliers
* Shapiro–Wilk test: If the p-value is lower than the chosen threshold, then the null hypothesis (Data is normally distributed) is rejected.
4. Low multicollinearity
* you can calculate the VIF (Variable Inflation Factors) using your favorite statistical tool. If the value for each covariate is lower than 10 (some say 5), you're good to go.

The figure below summarizes these assumptions.

### Q11: Explain briefly the K-Means clustering and how can we find the best value of K? ###
K-Means is a well-known clustering algorithm. K-means clustering is often used because it is easy to interpret and implement. The rest of the answer is [here](https://365datascience.com/career-advice/job-interview-tips/machine-learning-interview-questions-and-answers/#2:~:text=4.%20Briefly%20explain%20the%20K%2DMeans%20clustering%20and%20how%20can%20we%20find%20the%20best%20value%20of%C2%A0K.)

### Q12: Define Precision, recall, and F1 and discuss the trade-off between them? ###

Precision and recall are two classification evaluation metrics that are used beyond accuracy. The rest of the answer is [here](https://365datascience.com/career-advice/job-interview-tips/machine-learning-interview-questions-and-answers/#9:~:text=9.-,Define%20precision%2C%20recall%2C%20and%20F1%20and%20discuss%20the%20trade%2Doff%20between%C2%A0them.,-Precision%20and%20recall)

### Q13: What are the differences between a model that minimizes squared error and the one that minimizes the absolute error? and in which cases each error metric would be more appropriate? ###

Both mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) measures the distances between vectors and express average model prediction in units of the target variable. Both can range from 0 to infinity, the lower they are the better the model.

The main difference between them is that in MSE the errors are squared before being averaged while in MAE they are not. This means that a large weight will be given to large errors. MSE is useful when large errors in the model are trying to be avoided. This means that outliers affect MSE more than MAE, that is why MAE is more robust to outliers. 
Computation-wise MSE is easier to use as the gradient calculation will be more straightforward than MAE, which requires linear programming to calculate it.

### Q14: Define and compare parametric and non-parametric models and give two examples for each of them? ###

Answer:

**Parametric models** assume that the dataset comes from a certain function with some set of parameters that should be tuned to reach the optimal performance. For such models, the number of parameters is determined prior to training, thus the degree of freedom is limited and reduces the chances of overfitting.

Ex. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, LDA

**Nonparametric models** don't assume anything about the function from which the dataset was sampled. For these models, the number of parameters is not determined prior to training, thus they are free to generalize the model based on the data. Sometimes these models overfit themselves while generalizing. To generalize they need more data in comparison with Parametric Models. They are relatively more difficult to interpret compared to Parametric Models.

Ex. Decision Tree, Random Forest.

### Q15: Explain the kernel trick in SVM. Why do we use it and how to choose what kernel to use? ###
Answer:
Kernels are used in SVM to map the original input data into a particular higher dimensional space where it will be easier to find patterns in the data and train the model with better performance.

For eg.: If we have binary class data which form a ring-like pattern (inner and outer rings representing two different class instances) when plotted in 2D space, a linear SVM kernel will not be able to differentiate the two classes well when compared to an RBF (radial basis function) kernel, mapping the data into a particular higher dimensional space where the two classes are clearly separable.

Typically without the kernel trick, in order to calculate support vectors and support vector classifiers, we need first to transform data points one by one to the higher dimensional space, do the calculations based on SVM equations in the higher dimensional space, and then return the results. The ‘trick’ in the kernel trick is that we design the kernels based on some conditions as mathematical functions that are equivalent to a dot product in the higher dimensional space without even having to transform data points to the higher dimensional space. i.e. we can calculate support vectors and support vector classifiers in the same space where the data is provided which saves a lot of time and calculations.

Having domain knowledge can be very helpful in choosing the optimal kernel for your problem, however, in the absence of such knowledge following this default rule can be helpful:
For linear problems, we can try linear or logistic kernels, and for nonlinear problems, we can use RBF or Gaussian kernels.
